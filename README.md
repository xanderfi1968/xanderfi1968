- 👋 Hi, I’m @xanderfi1968

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python Kivy and some others
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this app with a few devevelopers who are willing to split the profits...  Of course this process could have many potential colaborators.  Please, only respond if you are willing to see this app till it's launch... The benefits of developing this app are HUGE!  I need help and I am willing to give the developers an equal share of commisions, sales, and all royalties rendered by this application...So, let the seed of this Money Tree grow...Grow...GROW
-  LET'S DO THIS
